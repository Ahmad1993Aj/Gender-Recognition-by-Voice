# Gender-Recognition-by-Voice
Gender Recognition by Voice and Speech Analysis


Voice Gender Dataset:
This dataset contains 3,168 recorded voice samples of male and female speakers. The data was collected from various sources and was pre-processed to extract a set of acoustical features that can be used to determine the gender of the speaker.

Data Description:

The dataset consists of 3,168 voice samples and 21 acoustic features, including:
1-Mean frequency (Hz)
2-Standard deviation of frequency (Hz)
3-Median frequency (Hz)
4-First quantile (Hz)
5-Third quantile (Hz)
6-Interquartile range (Hz)
7-Skewness (Hz)
8-Kurtosis (Hz)
9-Harmonic mean frequency (Hz)
10-Fundamental frequency (Hz)
11-Spectral centroid (Hz)
12-Spectral spread (Hz)
13-Spectral entropy
14-Spectral flux
15-Spectral rolloff
16-Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)

Purpose:
This dataset can be used for training and testing machine learning models for voice gender classification. The features in the dataset can be used to train a classifier to accurately determine the gender of the speaker based on their voice.

Usage:
The data is provided in a CSV format and can be easily loaded into a data analysis or machine learning software for analysis and modeling.
